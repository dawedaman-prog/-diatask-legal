          <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

          <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>By downloading or using DiaTask ("the Service"),
  users agree to these Terms of Service. If users do not agree,
  they should not use the Service.</p>

          <h2>2. About the Service</h2>
          <p>DiaTask enables voice‑powered task creation. Spoken
  input is transcribed via iOS Speech Recognition and sent to the
   OpenAI API to extract task details. Tasks are stored in
  Firebase Firestore, synchronized across devices, and reminders
  are delivered through push notifications. AI outputs may be
  incomplete or inaccurate; the Service is not intended for
  medical, legal, safety‑critical, or other high‑risk
  applications.</p>

          <h2>3. User Content and Ownership</h2>
          <p>Users retain ownership of content they provide
  (e.g., voice recordings, task descriptions). To operate the
  Service, DiaTask and its service providers receive a licence to
   process, store, and transmit user content. Users are
  responsible for ensuring their content is lawful and
  appropriate.</p>

          <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
          <p>Users agree not to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Engage in unlawful, high‑risk, or harmful
  activities through the Service.</li>
              <li>Generate or share content that is illegal,
  infringes others' rights, or violates applicable laws.</li>
              <li>Circumvent rate limits or attempt to
  reverse‑engineer, scrape, or extract proprietary code, models,
  or data.</li>
              <li>Violate the usage policies of service providers
   (such as OpenAI's policies).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
          <p>The Service depends on third‑party providers
  (Apple's Speech Recognition, OpenAI, Firebase, and push
  notification services). By using DiaTask, users authorise these
   providers to process content solely to operate the Service.
  DiaTask does not guarantee the availability or performance of
  third‑party services.</p>

          <h2>6. Disclaimers and Limitations</h2>
          <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available,"
  without warranties of accuracy, reliability, or suitability. To
   the maximum extent allowed by law, DiaTask and its affiliates
  are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential
  damages (including lost data or revenue) and limit total
  liability to amounts paid, if any, for the Service.</p>

          <h2>7. Termination</h2>
          <p>Access may be suspended or terminated at any time
  for misuse or violations of these Terms. Users may stop using
  the Service at any time. Upon termination, associated data may
  be deleted.</p>

          <h2>8. Updates to Terms</h2>
          <p>These Terms may be updated. Users will be informed
  of material changes via the Service or email. Continued use
  after an update indicates acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

          <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [state or
  country], and any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of
  [jurisdiction], unless applicable law requires a different
  forum.</p>

          <h2>10. Contact</h2>
          <p>For communications regarding these Terms, please
  email <strong>support@voxtask.info</strong>.</p>
