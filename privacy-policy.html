          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>DiaTask is a voice‑powered task management
  application that allows users to create tasks through speech.
  This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how
   it is used, and the choices available to users.</p>

          <h2>Information Collected</h2>
          <p><strong>Voice Recordings and
  Transcriptions:</strong> When a user taps the microphone and
  speaks a task, the spoken audio is captured and sent to Apple's
   iOS Speech Recognition service to convert the audio into text.
   The raw audio is deleted once transcription is complete.</p>

          <p><strong>Task Details:</strong> Transcribed text is
  sent to the OpenAI API to extract structured information such
  as task titles, dates/times, and categories. The resulting task
   data is stored in a database until the user deletes it.</p>

          <p><strong>Identifiers and Notifications:</strong> A
  device or temporary user identifier and push notification token
   are stored to deliver reminders. Minimal diagnostic data (such
   as request timing and token counts) is collected for
  reliability and abuse prevention.</p>

          <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> If a user
  signs up with an email and password or through another sign‑in
  provider, the information required to create and manage an
  account (using Firebase Authentication) is collected.</p>

          <h2>Use of Information</h2>
          <p><strong>Task Creation:</strong> Voice is transcribed
   to text, parsed to extract task details, and used to create
  task entries with automatic reminders (default: 10 minutes
  before the scheduled time).</p>

          <p><strong>Notifications:</strong> Device tokens enable
   scheduled local push notifications reminding users of upcoming
   tasks.</p>

          <p><strong>Application Functionality and
  Support:</strong> Diagnostic data helps maintain reliability,
  troubleshoot issues, and prevent misuse.</p>

          <p><strong>Cross‑Device Sync:</strong> Task data is
  stored in Firebase Firestore to ensure synchronization across
  devices.</p>

          <p>DiaTask does not sell data or use it for
  advertising.</p>

          <h2>Sharing and Processing</h2>
          <p><strong>Processors:</strong> Service providers are
  used only to operate DiaTask. These include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Apple's iOS Speech Recognition for on‑device or
   cloud transcription.</li>
              <li>OpenAI for text parsing and task
  extraction.</li>
              <li>Firebase (Google) for authentication and cloud
  storage.</li>
              <li>Push notification services such as Apple Push
  Notification Service.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Policies of Third Parties:</strong> OpenAI's
   API does not use customer API data to train models by default.
   Users should refer to OpenAI's service agreements and usage
  policies for more details.</p>

          <p><strong>No Third‑Party Advertising:</strong> Data is
   not shared with advertisers. Content is shared only as needed
  to operate or improve the service, prevent abuse, or comply
  with legal requirements.</p>

          <h2>Retention and Deletion</h2>
          <p><strong>Voice Recordings:</strong> Deleted
  immediately after transcription is completed.</p>

          <p><strong>Tasks:</strong> Persist until deleted by the
   user. Users may delete tasks individually or use a "Delete All
   Data" option within settings.</p>

          <p><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Retained only as long
  as necessary to maintain reliability and prevent misuse.</p>

          <p><strong>Accounts:</strong> Deleting an account
  removes the associated task data and authentication
  details.</p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>Data is protected in transit with TLS (HTTPS) and
  stored with access controls. While these measures enhance
  security, no system is entirely secure.</p>

          <h2>International Transfers</h2>
          <p>DiaTask operates in the United States and may
  process data on servers in other countries where service
  providers operate. Measures are taken to ensure an adequate
  level of data protection.</p>

          <h2>Children</h2>
          <p>The service is not directed to children under 13 (or
   under 16 where applicable). Personal data from children is not
   knowingly collected. If a parent or guardian believes a child
  has provided data, they may contact DiaTask to request
  deletion.</p>

          <h2>User Choices</h2>
          <p><strong>Permissions:</strong> Users may disable
  microphone access and notifications via device settings.</p>

          <p><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Users may delete
  individual tasks or use the "Delete All Data" option in
  settings. Users may also request deletion or correction of
  personal data by contacting support.</p>

          <p><strong>AI Disclaimer:</strong> AI‑generated outputs
   may be inaccurate or incomplete; users should not rely on
  DiaTask for medical, legal, or other safety‑critical
  purposes.</p>

          <h2>Changes</h2>
          <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated. Material changes
   will be communicated via the app or by email. Continued use of
   DiaTask after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated
  policy.</p>

  practices, please email
